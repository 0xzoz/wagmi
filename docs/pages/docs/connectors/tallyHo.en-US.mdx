# TallyHo

The `TallyHoConnector` supports connecting with TallyHo.

```ts
import { TallyHoConnector } from 'wagmi/connectors/tallyHo'
```

## Usage

```ts
import { TallyHoConnector } from 'wagmi/connectors/tallyHo'

const connector = new TallyHoConnector()
```

## Configuration

### chains (optional)

Chains supported by app. Defaults to `defaultChains`.

```ts {5}
import { chain } from 'wagmi'
import { TallyHoConnector } from 'wagmi/connectors/tallyHo'

const connector = new TallyHoConnector({
  chains: [chain.mainnet, chain.optimism],
})
```

### options (optional)

Options for configuring the connector.

```ts {4-6}
import { TallyHoConnector } from 'wagmi/connectors/tallyHo'

const connector = new TallyHoConnector({
  options: {
    shimDisconnect: true,
  },
})
```

#### UNSTABLE_shimOnConnectSelectAccount

<Callout emoji="ðŸš§">
  This is an experimental feature. It's stable enough to show up in the docs,
  but should be used with care. If you have any feedback, [create a
  discussion](https://github.com/wagmi-dev/wagmi/discussions).
</Callout>

While "disconnected" with `shimDisconnect`, allows user to select a different Tally Ho account (than the currently connected account) when trying to connect. Defaults to `false`.

```ts {6}
import { TallyHoConnector } from 'wagmi/connectors/tallyHo'

const connector = new TallyHoConnector({
  options: {
    shimDisconnect: true,
    UNSTABLE_shimOnConnectSelectAccount: true,
  },
})
```
